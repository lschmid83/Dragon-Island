/** Sets the auto-repeat parameters (all at once).
	\param keys
		Sets the keys affected by the autorepeat feature. If these keys are held for long enough, they will be reported more times in the pressed member in the osl_pad structure. It's the ideal thing to
		handle a menu, just check for the 'pressed' member and move the cursor when it's set. The auto-repeat feature will automatically work. Typical keys the user would expect to be auto-repeated are:
		OSL_KEYMASK_UP|OSL_KEYMASK_RIGHT|OSL_KEYMASK_DOWN|OSL_KEYMASK_LEFT|OSL_KEYMASK_R|OSL_KEYMASK_L. As you see, just OR the masks of the keys you want to be auto-repeated.
	\param init
		Time (in number of calls, so at 60 fps, 60 = 1 second) before the auto-repeat feature turns on. Usually you must wait a while (1/2 second or more) before the auto-repeat is turned on, but once
		it's on, the key will be repeated more than each 1/2 second. A typical value here is 40 (2/3 second).
	\param interval
		Time interval between each key repeat when the auto-repeat has been turned on. A typical value is 10 (1/6 of a second); with the example above, you would press the key, then 2/3 second later it
		begins to auto-repeat the key each 1/6 second.

/** Enables or disable automatic redirection from the analog stick to D-Pad buttons (down, left, etc.).
	\param sensivity
		Sensivity for the analog press. Analog values go from -128 to 127, so the maximum sensivity value you can set is 127,
		meaning the stick needs to be at least at -127 or +127 in each direction to be treated as a directional key.
		
		A typical value is 80, this leaves a sufficient space to avoid unintentioned diagonals, but is also small enough to be sensitive and
		comfortable.

\b Note: Diagonal keys are supported as well with the stick, and this is really a good idea to at least enable this if you don't want to threat
the stick separately. Some people (including me) have a weak D-Pad and it's extremely hard to play any game or app that needs the up/down
keys, or even worse: diagonals.

\code
//Enable default analog handler
oslSetKeyAnalogToDPad(80);
//Read keys
oslReadKeys();
//The stick is upwards OR the D-pad's up direction is held
if (osl_pad.held.up)
	{}

//If you want to differenciate stick and D-pad, you can also do something like this:

//Make sure default analog handler is disabled!
oslSetKeyAnalogToDPad(0);
oslReadKeys();
//D-Pad
if (osl_pad.held.up)
	{}
//Stick
if (osl_pad.analogY < -80)
